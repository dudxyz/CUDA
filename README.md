# CUDA

This repository contains **CUDA** code developed as part of my research on applied hardware acceleration. The projects explore the use of CUDA for parallel computing in the context of quantum algorithm simulation. 

This repository serves as a collection of experiments, prototypes, and optimized CUDA code related to my research. It aims to demonstrate the potential of dedicated hardware and parallel computing for advancing quantum computing simulations.
